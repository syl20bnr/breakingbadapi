        Hi, I'm Tim Biles. I am a developer in the Dallas, Fort Worth area in
        Texas. Breaking Bad is my favorite TV show. Check out my portfolio{' '}

      <Title secondary>What</Title>
      <Text>
        The Breaking Bad API is a collection of information on the Vince
        Gilligan series Breaking Bad, as well as his incredible spin-off Better
        Call Saul. This site is designed to make it easy on the developer to see
        what HTTP requests are possible, and what information is available.

        <Text>The following information is provided through this API...</Text>

      </ul>
      <Title secondary>Why</Title>
      <Text>
        Breaking Bad is regarded as one of the greatest television series of all
        time, and with 16 Primetime Emmy Awards, it is worthy of it's own API.
        In my search, I was unable to find an API that contained the amount of
        information I wanted, so I created one.
